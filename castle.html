        <h1>Castle</h1>
        <p>You haul your self up to an overhanging ledge. From here you are able to see the Castle Von Gott. It has two large turrets ether side of the large keep in which Lord and Lady Von Gott sleep. Lightning is still shattering the darkness. It was three days ago that both the Lord and Lady were murdered, their bodies were found in their bedroom. You push that to the  back of your and mind begin your climb to the top.
        </p>
        <p>You eventually reach the Castle Von Gott, its emmets size makes you gasps. Surrounding the Castle, a deep moat looms. About 7 meters deep and 6 across. A little way down the line you find a rickety bridge. This looks steady but it is impossible to tell in the middle, if it isnâ€™t stable you could fall through. In the other direction there is in front of you fallen tree. It seems young and tough but if it is rotten you could fall through.
