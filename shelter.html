        <h1>Shelter</h1>
        <p>You start searching around for any thing that you could use. You true through bog and marsh in till you come to the largest cavern you have ever seen. The mouth is about 5 meters top to bottom and 7 across. Your weary legs drag you inside. As you  start up a fire with the matches in your pocket a small piece of parchment is whipped into your cave. Curiosity causes you to haul your self up and stumble over to parchment. You heart jumps as you read the scrawly hand-writing of Lord Von Gott.</p>
        <p>

                My dearest Lady<br>
                My trip to Alaska will soon be cut short due to me missing thee. I have a new friend coming with me who is really looking forward to meeting thee. His name is Izitma or Iam as he insists on me calling him. See you soon my love.<br>
                Best regards from<br>
                Lord Von Gott
