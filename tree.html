        <h1>Tree trunk</h1>
        <p>You cautiously place one foot on the tree trunk, making sure you only commit half your weight to it. As you edge forward, it creaks ominously. The moat below looks foamy and merciless like a sea in a storm. You warily slide on to your front and shimmy across the first few meters. All the while, the tree moans  and screeches with every tiny movement you make.</p>
        <p>After a few minutes that seemed like hours, you arrive in the last stretch of tree. The ground looks solid and safe. You reach out with one dripping hand and grab hold of a loose root protruding from the end of the trunk. You heave yourself with all your remaining strength an haul your water logged body onto the back of the moat.</p>
        <p>The ground is a welcome felling after so long in the air. You glance up and your heart drops. In front of your is an indestructible wall of vines. The wall is jade green with small ruby red, thorn covered blooms sprouting up all over the place. You spot a small section were the groth is less dence and you could scrabble through with your hands, which would use less energy. Although, you could use the machete and hack your way through, which could bring you closer to the castle.</p>
