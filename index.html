        <h1>Murder at dragon tooth rock</h1>
        <p>Around you the sea rages. Ahead, Dragon Tooth Rock looms the storm. As the jagged lightning cracks the blackness you get a glimpse of Castle Von Gott. You are 25 and have just been accepted into the F.B.I. As your first case you must solve the mystery of the Von Gott murder.</p>
        <p>Finally, after what seemed like a journey that would never end, you land on Dragon Tooth Rock. Through the booming thunder you stagger, dragging your feet behind you. Your heavy iron boots are caked in mud. You need shelter, but the longer you wait to solve the crime the less you will get paid.</p>
        <p><a href="shelter.html">Find shelter</a> or <a href="castle.html">continue to Castle Von Gott</a>.</p>
