        <h1>Bridge</h1>
        <p>Slowly, you shuffle across the swaying bridge. One by one, you step over the shaking wooden slats. Around you, the storm continued to rage. Your mind momentarily slips away from the bridge, your heart leaps as your foot falls through a large gap. The slat under your other foot falls away and you drop though the bridge. As you fall you grab hold of a loose slat. You swing under the bridge and are momentarily frozen high above the churning, merciless water.</p>
        <p>Bad choice. A rotten slat hangs over your head, you drop the line of wood you are currently clinging to and grab hold of the new one just before you fall. All that is stopping you from plunging to your death is one ancient piece of wood. If this gives wayâ€¦ You stop panicking, throw one hand over your head and grab hold of the fraying guard rope in one blistered hand. You are trembling so much that the rope begins to violently vibrate. You muster all of your strength and heave yourself up back onto the slat just before the hole in the bridge. Your heart is in your mouth as you realise that your machete has fallen from your belt whilst you were swinging. You prudently peer over the guide rope and there is the machete floating in the moat below.</p>
        <p>Not long after, you arrive in front of a walk of vines. The long roots are jade Green with ruby red, thorn covered blooms sprouting up everywhere. With out the machete it will be near impossible to get through. You scramble aimlessly around for a gap in the wall but it is hopeless. You hands are now dripping with blood from the thorns and you are sadly forced to turn around. GAME-OVER</p>
