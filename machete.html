        <h1>Machete</h1>
        <p>As you continue to hack at the vines, your mind wonders back to the murder. The night it was commited there was evidence of servants entering the master bedroom. Then in the morning the bodies were found. Perhaps a servant was the perpetrator.</p>
        <p>After a few minutes of constant hacking you break through the last of the vines. You have burst through the wall directly in front of the castle. Good thinking using the machete. You pause to catch your breath for a minute (bush-whacking was never your thing). The castle is huge. Its walls are draped in a blanket of ivy and the windows boarded up. It looks totally abandoned.</p>
        <p>Straight ahead are the huge, oak front doors of the castle. They creak and moan in the wind. As you watch they seem to tilt forward. Creeping in, as though they might fall down at any moment, you glance to the left and see a small rusted door that must have been a servants' entrance. It looks chained up but you never know. The door may fall on you any second but the servants' door looks chained. Which way should you go?</p>
